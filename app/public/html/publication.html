Identifying Learning Profiles of Children at Risk for Specific Reading Disability. Developmental Science.</a><br><br>
                <p>Differences in learning patterns of vocabulary acquisition in children at risk (+SRD) and not at risk (-SRD) for Specific Reading Disability (SRD) were examined using a microdevelopmental paradigm applied to the multi-trial Foreign Language Learning Task (FLLT; Baddeley et al., 1995). The FLLT was administered to 905 children from rural Chitonga-speaking Zambia. A multi-group Latent Growth Curve Model (LGCM) was implemented to study interindividal differences in intraindividual change across trials. Results showed that the +SRD group recalled fewer words correctly in the first trial, learned at a slower rate during the subsequent trials, and demonstrated a more linear learning pattern compared to the -SRD group. This study illustrates the promise of LGCM applied to multi-trial learning tasks, by isolating three components of the learning process (initial recall, rate of learning, and functional pattern of learning). Implications of this microdevelopmental approach to SRD research in low-to-middle income countries are discussed.</p>

                <p>Although creativity is considered one of the key “21st century skills”, this ability is still often misunderstood. Persistent conceptual and methodological barriers have limited educational implications. This article reviews and discusses the three critical issues of “nature”, “measure”, and “nurture” of creative potential in educational settings. A current perspective on the nature of creative potential is presented. In contrasts to a classic, but inaccurate “g-factor view” of creativity, this perspective emphasizes a multidimensional and partly domain-specific view, upon which new assessment tools can be developed. Based on a more comprehensive evaluation of a child’s creative potential, educational programs tailored to a child’s strengths and weaknesses can be offered. These perspectives are discussed in light of current findings in the field.</p>

Through a popularization of the idiographic approach and associated statistical techniques, but also through technical advances in the apparatus used to produce single-case intensive longitudinal data, the “power” of “N=1” is becoming increasingly tangible and may challenge, or supplement, established paradigms in nomothetic (group-level) developmental psychology.</p>
